// Full binary trees (binary trees whose nodes have zero or two children) can be encoded as strings of balanced parentheses (in fact, the two things are isomorphic). Your task is to figure out such an encoding, and write the two functions which convert back and forth between the full binary trees and strings of parentheses.

// Here's the definition of full binary trees:

// class Tree {}
// class Leaf extends Tree {}
// class Branch extends Tree { constructor(left,right) {} }
// And here are the functions you need to define:

// function treeToParens(Tree) => String
// function parensToTree(String) => Tree
// The first function needs to return only strings of valid balanced parentheses (like "()(())").
// The second needs to accept any string of balanced parentheses.

// Also, the functions need to be inverses of each other.
// In other words, they need to satisfy the following equations:

// treeToParens(parensToTree(parens)) === parens
// parensToTree(treeToParens(tree)) === tree
// Note:

// There is more than one possible answer to this puzzle! There are number of different ways to "encode" a full binary tree as a string of parentheses. Any solution that follows the laws above will be accepted.

// Your functions will run in sandboxes; only Tree, Leaf, Branch and console ( for .log ) will be in scope, and they will be frozen. If you need helper functions, define them inside your functions. If you experience any problems with this setup, please leave a comment in the Discourse.


function treeToParens(tree) {
  return tree instanceof Leaf ? '' : `(${treeToParens(tree.left)})${treeToParens(tree.right)}`;
}

function parensToTree(parens) {
  var i=0;
  return (function _parensToTree() {
    return parens[i] === '(' ? new Branch(_parensToTree(i++), _parensToTree(i++)) : new Leaf;
  })();
}
